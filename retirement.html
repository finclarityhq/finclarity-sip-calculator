            Retirement in the 21st century is no longer a destination; it is a complex engineering challenge involving longevity risk, inflation, and healthcare costs. The old Indian dream of "Living off FD Interest" has been decimated by falling interest rates and rising taxes. Today, a professional retirement plan requires a Systematic Withdrawal Plan (SWP) built on an equity-led foundation.

        <h2>I. The Longevity Risk & The Inflation Trap</h2>
        <p>
            The greatest threat to a retiree is not a market crash; it is living too long. With advancements in medical science, an Indian retiree at 60 must plan for at least 30 more years of cash flow. Over 30 years, even a modest 6% inflation rate will reduce the purchasing power of your money by 80%. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Traditional annuities (pensions) from insurance companies typically offer a fixed 5-6% return. While this feels "safe," it is a guaranteed loss in real terms because the payout never increases to match inflation. In contrast, an SWP allows your principal to remain invested in growth assets, ensuring your "pension" can grow as the cost of living rises.
        </p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
            <h4 class="text-indigo-500 font-black uppercase text-xs mb-3">Institutional Truth</h4>
            <p class="text-white font-bold italic text-xl leading-snug">
                The 12% Reality: Healthcare inflation in India is running at double the retail inflation. A medical procedure costing ₹5 Lakh today will cost ₹45 Lakh in 20 years. Your portfolio must be an engine, not a park-bench.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h2>II. The Three-Bucket Architecture</h2>
        <p>
            To manage "Sequence of Returns Risk" (the risk of a market crash occurring right when you start withdrawing), institutional investors use the Bucket Strategy:
        </p>
        <h3>Bucket 1: The Cash Reserve (0-2 Years)</h3>
        <p>
            This bucket contains 24 months of expenses parked in Liquid or Overnight funds. This is your "Sleep Well" money. When the market is in a bear phase, you draw from here, giving your equity investments time to recover.
        </p>
        <h3>Bucket 2: The Defensive Buffer (3-7 Years)</h3>
        <p>
            Contains 5 years of expenses in Conservative Hybrid or Equity Savings funds. These offer moderate growth with low volatility and refill Bucket 1 as it depletes.
        </p>
        <h3>Bucket 3: The Growth Engine (7+ Years)</h3>
        <p>
            The remainder of your corpus stays in Nifty 50 Index funds and Mid-cap funds. This bucket is the only reason you will outlive your money. Over a 7+ year horizon, equity has a near-100% probability of outperforming debt.
        </p>

        <h2>III. Tax Arbitrage: SWP vs. FD Interest</h2>
        <p>
            In the 2025 tax regime, FD interest is taxed at your income slab (up to 39%). However, an SWP from an equity fund is taxed as 12.5% LTCG. Crucially, in an SWP, you only pay tax on the *capital gain* portion of the withdrawal, not the principal. This results in a massive "Tax Alpha," effectively extending your portfolio's life by 5-8 years compared to an FD.
        </p>

        <h2>IV. The Sustainable Withdrawal Rate</h2>
        <p>
            While the global "4% Rule" is famous, the Indian context of 12% equity returns and 6% inflation allows for a <strong>5.5% Withdrawal Rate</strong>. If your corpus is ₹5 Crore, a 5.5% SWP provides ₹27.5 Lakh annually (₹2.3 Lakh/month), which can be increased by 5% every year to fight inflation.
        </p>
        <p>
            The conclusion is clear: The "Fixed Pension" is dead. The "Systematic Harvest" is the only path to a dignified, inflation-proof retirement in Bharat.
