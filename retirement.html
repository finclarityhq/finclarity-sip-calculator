        <article class="space-y-12 text-lg">
            <p class="drop-cap">The traditional Indian retirement was built on the foundation of 'Safety.' Fixed Deposits, Post Office Schemes, and the ubiquitous Life Insurance Annuity. But in 2026, 'Safe' has become a dangerous word. With healthcare inflation running at 12% and lifestyle costs rising, a fixed pension is a slow-motion architectural failure.</p>
            
            <h2 class="text-3xl mt-20 mb-8 italic">I. The Death of the Annuity</h2>
            <p>An annuity is a contract where you give a massive lump sum to an insurer, and they pay you a fixed 5-6% for life. The catch? The principal is often gone, and that 6% stays 6% forever. In 15 years, your purchasing power is halved. The **Systematic Withdrawal Plan (SWP)** flips this script.</p>
            
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h4 class="text-indigo-400 font-black uppercase text-xs mb-4">The SWP Advantage</h4>
                <p class="text-white font-bold text-xl mb-2 italic">Equity Participation + Tax Arbitrage</p>
                <p class="text-sm opacity-80 leading-relaxed">By keeping your core corpus in a growth-oriented fund and withdrawing only a fixed amount, your remaining money continues to compound. Furthermore, SWP withdrawals are taxed as Capital Gains (12.5% LTCG), whereas FD interest is taxed at your income slab (up to 30%+).</p>
            </div>

            <h2 class="text-3xl mt-20 mb-8 italic">II. The Three-Bucket Architecture</h2>
            <p>Professional retirees don't just 'withdraw.' They architect their corpus into three distinct buckets to mitigate <strong>Sequence of Returns Risk</strong>:</p>
            
            <ul class="space-y-6 list-none border-l border-white/10 pl-8">
                <li><strong class="text-white uppercase text-sm block mb-1">Bucket 1: Immediate (0-2 Years)</strong>
                    <span class="text-slate-500">Parked in Liquid and Overnight funds. This is your "Sleep Well" money. Market crashes don't affect your groceries.</span>
                </li>
                <li><strong class="text-white uppercase text-sm block mb-1">Bucket 2: Defensive (3-7 Years)</strong>
                    <span class="text-slate-500">Hybrid and Equity-Savings funds. This bucket refills Bucket 1 and provides moderate growth with low volatility.</span>
                </li>
                <li><strong class="text-white uppercase text-sm block mb-1">Bucket 3: Growth (7+ Years)</strong>
                    <span class="text-slate-500">Diversified Equity and Index funds. This is the engine of your wealth that ensures your corpus outlives you.</span>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="text-3xl mt-20 mb-8 italic">III. The Math of Sustainability</h2>
            <p>The global standard is the "4% Rule," but in the Indian context—with 12% equity growth and 6% inflation—a <strong>5.5% Withdrawal Rate</strong> is the 'Ultra' sweet spot. This allows your payout to increase annually to match inflation while your principal remains robust.</p>
