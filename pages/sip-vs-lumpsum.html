<!-- ===== Intro ===== -->
<section>
  <p>
    When investing in mutual funds, investors are often confused between two popular methods:
    <strong>Systematic Investment Plan (SIP)</strong> and <strong>Lumpsum investment</strong>.
    Both approaches have their advantages and are suitable under different circumstances.
  </p>

  <p>
    This guide explains SIP vs Lumpsum in simple terms, compares their risks and returns,
    and helps you decide which option suits you best.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- ===== What is SIP ===== -->
<section>
  <h2>What is SIP?</h2>
  <p>
    SIP (Systematic Investment Plan) is an investment method where you invest a fixed amount
    at regular intervals (usually monthly) into a mutual fund.
  </p>
  <p>
    SIP allows investors to start with small amounts, promotes financial discipline,
    and reduces the impact of market volatility through rupee cost averaging.
  </p>
  <p>
    SIPs are especially popular among salaried individuals and long-term investors in India.
  </p>

<!-- ===== What is Lumpsum ===== -->
<section>
  <h2>What is Lumpsum Investment?</h2>
  <p>
    Lumpsum investment means investing a large amount of money in a mutual fund in one single transaction.
    This approach is usually adopted when an investor has surplus funds available.
  </p>
  <p>
    Lumpsum investing can generate higher returns if done at the right market levels,
    but it also carries higher timing risk.

<!-- ===== Which is Better ===== -->
<section>
  <h2>Which is Better: SIP or Lumpsum?</h2>
  <p>
    There is no universally better option. The choice between SIP and Lumpsum depends on
    your income pattern, risk tolerance, market conditions, and investment horizon.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>SIP</strong> is ideal if you have a regular income and want to invest gradually without worrying about market timing.
    <strong>Lumpsum</strong> works better if you have surplus money and confidence in market conditions.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- ===== Example ===== -->
<section>
  <h2>SIP vs Lumpsum: Simple Example</h2>
  <p>
    Suppose you invest ₹5,000 per month through SIP for 10 years versus investing ₹6,00,000 as a lumpsum.
    The final returns may vary depending on market performance and volatility.
