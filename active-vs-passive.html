        <h2>I. The SPIVA Reality Check</h2>
        <p>The Standard & Poor’s Index Versus Active (SPIVA) scorecard for India has consistently highlighted a brutal truth: as the Indian market becomes more efficient, active fund managers are finding it nearly impossible to beat their benchmarks. In the Large Cap category, over 80% of active funds have underperformed the Nifty 50 over a 5-year period.</p>
        <p>This is not due to a lack of talent, but due to <strong>Market Maturation</strong>. In the 1990s, information was asymmetric. Today, every institutional desk has the same Bloomberg terminal and the same high-speed data. When everyone is smart, nobody gets to be 'Alpha'.</p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
            <h4 class="text-blue-500 font-black uppercase text-xs mb-2">The 1% Silent Killer</h4>
            <p class="text-slate-300">An active fund typically charges 1.5% to 2% in expense ratios (TER). An index fund charges 0.1% to 0.2%. Over 30 years, that 1.5% difference eats away nearly 30% of your terminal wealth. You are paying the manager to lose you money.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>II. The "Survivorship Bias" Trap</h2>
        <p>When investors look at active funds, they only see the winners that exist today. They forget the hundreds of funds that were merged or shut down because of poor performance. This is Survivorship Bias. Index funds eliminate this risk by simply owning the market.</p>
        
        <h2>III. Tracking Error & Impact Cost</h2>
        <p>Passive investing isn't without its own metrics. We analyze the 'Tracking Error'—the difference between the index return and the fund return. A professional architect looks for funds with the lowest tracking error and the highest AUM to minimize impact costs during large redemptions.</p>

        <h2>IV. The Mid-Cap and Small-Cap Exception?</h2>
        <p>While Large Caps are efficient, do Active managers still win in Mid and Small caps? We deconstruct the data showing that even here, the 'Alpha' is shrinking. The rise of Mid-cap 150 Index funds and Small-cap 250 Index funds is providing a low-cost alternative that most active managers cannot beat after accounting for their higher fees.</p>

        <h2>V. Conclusion: The Core-Satellite Approach</h2>
        <p>The 2026 roadmap suggests a 70% allocation to Passive Index funds (Core) and a 30% allocation to specific high-conviction Active funds or Direct Stocks (Satellite). This balances the certainty of market returns with the potential for outsized gains.</p>
