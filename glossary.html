            <!-- Term 1 -->
            <div class="glossary-card">
                <span class="term">XIRR (Extended Internal Rate of Return)</span>
                <p class="text-sm leading-relaxed">The most accurate measure for SIP returns. Unlike CAGR, which only looks at the start and end, XIRR accounts for the timing of every single installment. In a volatile market, XIRR is your true north.</p>
            </div>
            <!-- Term 2 -->
            <div class="glossary-card">
                <span class="term">LTCG (Long Term Capital Gains)</span>
                <p class="text-sm leading-relaxed">Post-2024, this stands at 12.5% for equity held over 12 months. The first ₹1.25 Lakh is exempt. Understanding the 'Grandfathering' clause is key for pre-2018 investments.</p>
            </div>
            <!-- Term 3 -->
            <div class="glossary-card">
                <span class="term">TER (Total Expense Ratio)</span>
                <p class="text-sm leading-relaxed">The annual fee charged by mutual funds. Even a 0.5% difference in TER can result in a ₹50 Lakh difference in your 30-year corpus. Always prefer Direct Plans to minimize this.</p>
            </div>
            <!-- Term 4 -->
            <div class="glossary-card">
                <span class="term">Standard Deviation</span>
                <p class="text-sm leading-relaxed">A measure of volatility. A fund with high returns but high standard deviation means your journey will be a roller-coaster. Institutional investors look for a 'Sharpe Ratio'—return per unit of risk.</p>
            </div>
            <!-- Term 5 -->
            <div class="glossary-card">
                <span class="term">STT (Securities Transaction Tax)</span>
                <p class="text-sm leading-relaxed">A direct tax levied on every purchase and sale of equities on the exchange. It is the 'toll tax' of the Indian stock market, collected at source by the exchanges.</p>

            <p>Most retail investors fail because they use the wrong vocabulary. They talk about 'Profit' when they should talk about 'Post-Tax Real Returns'. They talk about 'Safety' when they should talk about 'Inflation Protection'. This glossary is designed to upgrade your mental software...</p>
