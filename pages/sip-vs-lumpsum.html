    (monthly/quarterly) into a mutual fund. It helps investors benefit from rupee cost
    averaging and disciplined investing.

    SIP is widely preferred by salaried individuals and long-term investors in India.

  <h2>Which is Better: SIP or Lumpsum?</h2>
  <p>
    There is no single correct answer. The choice depends on:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Your income pattern</li>
    <li>Market conditions</li>
    <li>Risk tolerance</li>
    <li>Investment horizon</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    <strong>SIP</strong> is ideal for most investors as it reduces timing risk and encourages consistency.
    <strong>Lumpsum</strong> may offer higher returns if invested at the right market level.
  </p>

  <h2>SIP vs Lumpsum: Example</h2>
  <p>

    lumpsum. The final returns may vary depending on market performance, volatility, and timing.
